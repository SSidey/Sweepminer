# Run Baseline Rubric

Every implementation pass — a full plan stage or an ad-hoc prompt that changes source —
is checked against this table at its declared end. All rows here are mechanical; there
is no manual-review row in this table by design (qualitative judgement belongs in
`principles/progress-tracking.md` Gate 2, which runs separately and later).

## Structured (machine-checkable, hard gate)

| Name | Description | Threshold | Pass Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tests-red-then-green` | For `code`/`hybrid` specs, the test(s) for new behaviour failed before implementation and pass after | Documented red→green transition per `principles/tdd-bdd-workflow.md` | Test run log shows both states |
| `contract-tests-pass` | Every implementation of a base type/interface with 2+ implementations passes the shared contract-test suite unmodified | 100% pass | Test runner exit 0 across all implementations |
| `coverage-overall` | Overall line coverage | ≥90% (configurable, `config/thresholds.yaml`) | Coverage tool report |
| `coverage-changed-lines` | Coverage on new/changed lines specifically | ≥90% (configurable) | Coverage tool report, diff-scoped |
| `lint-clean` | Project linter (stack-specific) reports zero errors | Zero errors | Linter exit 0 |
| `srp-size` | No file/function exceeds configured size thresholds without a Decision | Zero unrecorded violations | Static check against `config/thresholds.yaml` |
| `ocp-shotgun-surgery` | No new case/behaviour touches ≥ configured number of pre-existing files | Below threshold | Diff-scoped static check |
| `isp-method-count` | No interface exceeds configured method-count threshold | Below threshold | Static check |
| `isp-stub-detection` | No implementer body is a not-implemented/no-op stub for a required method | Zero | Static/AST scan |
| `dip-direction` | No dependency edge from high-level/domain module to low-level/infrastructure module in the wrong direction | Zero violations | Dependency-graph analysis |
| `naming-grep-discoverable` | No identifier exceeds configured max grep-hit count while being generic | Zero unrecorded violations | Grep-count check |
| `no-cross-cutting-helper-violation` | No helper below the promotion threshold has been extracted into a shared file; no helper at/above threshold remains duplicated instead of promoted | Zero violations | Static check |
| `progress-trend` | Rubric pass count, test count, lint warnings, and size budgets have not regressed versus the pre-change baseline | No regression, per `principles/progress-tracking.md` Gate 1 | Log comparison |
| `commit-message-conforms` | Commit message(s) conform to Conventional Commits, and the declared type matches the actual diff (e.g. no `fix:` that adds a new public API) | 100% conformance | Commit-lint + diff-type cross-check |
| `branch-name-conforms` | Branch name conforms to Conventional Branch | Conformance | Branch-name lint |

## Where this runs

- **Locally**, via the pre-commit framework, on changed files, for fast feedback before
  a commit is made.
- **In CI**, on the full changed set, as the authoritative, required gate before merge —
  see the stack-specific `ci/<stack>/` implementation for exact wiring.

A failure in any row here means the implementation pass is **not complete**. This is
independent of and prior to the human qualitative gate in
`principles/progress-tracking.md`.
